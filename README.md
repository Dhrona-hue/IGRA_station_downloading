# IGRA Radiosonde Data Downloader and Transformer

## Overview

This Python script allows you to download IGRA (Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive) Radiosonde station data directly from the IGRA website. It then transforms the required profiles into Excel format for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (>=3.6)
Required Python libraries such as igra,pandas,numpy,matplotlib,scipy,siphon.simplewebservice.igra2
which can be downloaded by using pip or conda.
here is an example of how to install the required libraries using pip;

1. pip install igra
2. pip install pandas
3. pip install numpy
4. pip install matplotlib
5. pip install scipy
6. pip install siphon

This is how we install the pre-requisite libraries using pip and those who are using anaconda prompt can change the pip to conda. for example instead of pip use conda install igra and so on


Internet connectivity to access the IGRA website is necessary
